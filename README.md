# cat-dog-cnn
This project implements a `Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)` to classify images of cats and dogs.

The CNN is implemented with the deep learning framework `PyTorch`.

The data is taken from `kaggle` (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog).

As part of the project, a `Class Activation Map (CAM)` is implemented to anaylze the features that are relevant to classify the images.
